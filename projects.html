        Projects & Exercises<br><br>
        In addition to readings, discussions, and tutorials, students will complete three projects in addition to
        several exercises. Exercises are meant as scenarios for practicing newly learned web-development concepts.
        Projects in this course are the main and most important work students will complete in this course, they should
        have a strong conceptual framework and be finessed and functional in its final delivery.

                <p>Due: Tuesday, March 1</p>
                <p>Choose a place, it can be a real place, or be made up. Metaphorical spaces are also encouraged for
                    this project. </p>
                <ul class="a">
                    <li>PART 1 (Visual Essay):<br>
                        Write an extended description of the place you chose. To get you started, think about how the
                        place sounds, how it smells, how it makes you feel, etc. Does this place exist? Is it made up?
                        Is it a place from a different time period? Is it from the past, or the future? Is it on this
                        planet? If writing about the same place from EX.1, revisit your writing from before and build on
                        it, or start over—this writing should be new. Use photos/drawings/sounds/videos to supplement
                        your description. All media should be your own.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>PART 2 (Artifact):<br> Make an artifact that represents your place. It can take the shape of
                        anything, like a letter, a fax, a book/pamphlet, a post-card, a necklace, a piece of clothing, a
                        thumbdrive, a sculpture, etc. The artifact should be something tangible, meaning, it should be
                        something that can be held in your hand. Refer back to your writing to generate ideas. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>PART 3 HTML:<br>Using HTML only, create a multipage tour of this place. The pages should be
                        linked together using <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags. Your original writing should be included on
                        one of these pages, the order/location in which it appears is up to you. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>PART 4 CSS:<br>Make a second version of your tour using HTML and CSS. This version can be
                        totally different from Part 2. </li>

                <p>FINAL CRIT: April 5</p>

                              <p>Design a new layout for a text you find from the library using HTML and CSS. Your interactive
                    experience should invite the reader to experience not only the story, but also your interpretation
                    of the story. Use what you’ve learned so far—hypertext, responsive design, color, html, css—to
                    transform this story from a print experience to a reading experience that is lives in the browser.

                <p><em>Metaphor is the meeting point, not of two words, but of two structures.<br> — Ulises Carrión </em></p>

                <p><em>“Unrestricted by sequence, in hypertext we may create new forms of writing which better reflect
                        the structure of what we are writing about; and the readers, choosing a pathway, may follow
                        their interests or current line of thought in a way heretofore considered impossible.”

                <ul class="a">
                    <li>To translate a printed story, or essay, into an online reading experience.</li>
                    <li>To generate design and interaction concepts from themes within the story.</li>
                    <li>To experiment with how navigation can influence the reading experience—and compare it to analog
                        forms of navigation (table of contents, footnotes, etc). </li>
                    <li>To use typography to express meaning, and encourage new interpretations.</li>

                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>REQUIREMENTS</p>

                <ul class="a">
                    <li>Text Title</li>
                    <li>Text Author</li>
                    <li>Text must be at least 1,500 words long.</li>
                    <li>Original text must be found in the library, and be in print. </li>
                    <li>Use media queries so your design works on multiple screen widths. </li>
                    <li>You may use no more than two typefaces.</li>
                    <li>Type only—no images allowed. </li>
                    <li>Must use your entire text.</li>
                    <li>Style links—consider hover states, color, etc. </li>
                    <li>Minimum 1 page.</li>
                </ul>
<br>
                <p>CONSIDER</p>
                <ul class="a">
                    <li>Interpretation: Your interpretation of this text is unique to you. What comes to mind when you read this text? In order to properly analyze and interpret a text, you will need to read it multiple times. As you read your text, mark it up with your notes, write down any questions, or what comes to mind. Don't let these thoughts come and go. Keep track of them. Consider how your interpretation of the text can translate to a new reading experience. The most
                        successful projects will have a single point of view expressed through a decisive design move.
                    </li>
                    <li>Sequence: What is the experience of reading this text in print? What is the pacing like? How is the text organized? Is the author in conversation with themselves? With others? How are the footnotes, and endnotes referenced? Think about the sequence you would like to set up for an online reading of this text. </li>
                    <li>Typography: How does the typography enhance your point of view and help you convey meaning? Pay
                        attention to typographic details: special characters, leading, words per line, etc. Are there multiple perspectives in this text? How can those perspectives be made visual through type?</li>
                    <li>Interaction: How does the viewer/reader progress through the story, scrolling, clicking,
                        hover-states, pop-ups, resizing browser, all of the above? </li>
                    <li>Links: How do internal/external links or anchors enhance the meaning of this text? What is revealed? What is hidden?</li>
                    <li>Page width: What happens to your site when the browser window is resized? Is it the same? Is it
                        a different design? Are only certain pieces of information accessible at certain viewport sizes?
                    </li>
                    <p><em>Do not try to illustrate the text. The least successful projects will be ones that try to
                        visualize the text literally. Remember this project is also about how YOU are interpreting the text. </em></p>

                PART 1<br>
                Due: March 3
                <br>
                <ol>
                
                    <li>Find a printed text from the library, scan it and save it as a pdf. Once you’ve chosen this
                        text, read it multiple times, and write a short response to this text. What is it about? Pay
                        close attention to how the text was written—word choices, tone, etc. Are metaphors used? Is the
                        text descriptive? How are nouns and adjectives used? </li>
                    <li>Based on how you interpreted the text, what do you want to point out to the reader in your
                        browser-based design?</li>
                    <li>Record your observations and ideas, be prepared to discuss in class. </li>
                    <li><em>Then</em> create a list of 10 or more words, phrases, ideas that describe your text. </li>
                    <li>Link all of this on your class website and label it “Project 2: Part 1”</li>

                </ol>
                <br>
                PART 2<br>
                Due: March 10
                <br>
                <ol>
                  
                    <li>Come up with three distinct design directions for how you will design this text as an online
                        reading experience. Write a description for each concept. Share your sketches, these can be made
                        using InDesign, Photoshop, or Figma—or any combination of these. If you have any design
                        references, share these as well. In this initial phase, your sketches should communicate what
                        overarching the concept is.</li>

                        <li>Remember, your ideas should connect to your interpretation of the text.</li>

                    <li>Your sketches should include ideas for mobile and desktop views. </li>
                    <li>Consider how the user/reader will navigate through your site. What is the navigation system
                        like? How does it connect to each concept?</li>
                    <li>Think about the structure, is it one page? If it’s more, consider drawing a wireframe to give an
                        overview of the pages. </li>
                    <li>Each direction should only use type, no images or illustrations. Graphic elements are allowed;
                        borders, background colors, etc. </li>
                    <li>Compile your sketches, and research into a document (web-page, GoogleDoc, etc.). You will share
                        this in class. </li>
                    <li>Link this on your class website and label it “Project 2: Part 2”</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                PART 3<br>
