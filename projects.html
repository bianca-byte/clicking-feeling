    About Projects & Exercises<br><br>
    In addition to readings, discussions, and tutorials, students will complete three projects in addition to several exercises. Exercises are meant as scenarios for practicing newly learned web-development concepts. Projects in this course are the main and most important work students will complete in this course, they should have a strong conceptual framework and be finessed and functional in its final delivery.

         <p>Project 1: Space—Place—Artifact </p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion-panel">
            <p>Due: Tuesday, February 22</p>
<p>Choose a place, it can be a real place, or be made up. </p>        <ul class="a">   
        <li>Part 1 (Visual Essay):<br>
            Write an extended description of the place you chose. To get you started, think about how the place sounds, how it smells, how it makes you feel, etc. Does this place exist? Is it made up? Is it a place from a different time period? Is it from the past, or the future? Is it on this planet? If writing about the same place from EX.1, revisit your writing from before and build on it, or start over—this writing should be new. Use photos/drawings/sounds/videos to supplement your description. All media should be your own. 
        </li>
        <br>
       <li>Part 2 (Artifact):<br> Make an artifact that represents your place. It can take the shape of anything, like a letter, a fax, a book/pamphlet, a post-card, a necklace, a piece of clothing, a thumbdrive, a sculpture, etc. The artifact should be something tangible, meaning, it should be something that can be held in your hand. Refer back to your writing to generate ideas. </li>
        <br>
       <li>Part 3 HTML:<br>Using HTML only, create a multipage tour of this place. The pages should be linked together using <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags. Your original writing should be included on one of these pages, the order/location in which it appears is up to you. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Part 4 CSS:<br>Make a second version of your tour using HTML and CSS. This version can be totally different from Part 2. </li>

            <li>Part 2:<br> Using only HTML, make 10 pages that display your writing from Part 1. Begin to experiment with how the available HTML tags can visually shape your writing. </li>

                    <p>What is for dinner? What’s on the table? In this exercise you will use HTML tables to recreate your dinner table, and then use CSS to give it some style.  </p>
