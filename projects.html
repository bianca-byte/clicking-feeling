        Projects & Exercises<br><br>
        In addition to readings, discussions, and tutorials, students will complete three projects in addition to
        several exercises. Exercises are meant as scenarios for practicing newly learned web-development concepts.
        Projects in this course are the main and most important work students will complete in this course, they should
        have a strong conceptual framework and be finessed and functional in its final delivery.

                <p>Project 1: Space—Place—Artifact </p>
            </div>
            <div class="accordion-panel">
                <p>Due: Tuesday, March 1</p>
                <p>Choose a place, it can be a real place, or be made up. Metaphorical spaces are also encouraged for this project. </p>
                <ul class="a">
                    <li>Part 1 (Visual Essay):<br>
                        Write an extended description of the place you chose. To get you started, think about how the
                        place sounds, how it smells, how it makes you feel, etc. Does this place exist? Is it made up?
                        Is it a place from a different time period? Is it from the past, or the future? Is it on this
                        planet? If writing about the same place from EX.1, revisit your writing from before and build on
                        it, or start over—this writing should be new. Use photos/drawings/sounds/videos to supplement
                        your description. All media should be your own.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Part 2 (Artifact):<br> Make an artifact that represents your place. It can take the shape of
                        anything, like a letter, a fax, a book/pamphlet, a post-card, a necklace, a piece of clothing, a
                        thumbdrive, a sculpture, etc. The artifact should be something tangible, meaning, it should be
                        something that can be held in your hand. Refer back to your writing to generate ideas. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Part 3 HTML:<br>Using HTML only, create a multipage tour of this place. The pages should be
                        linked together using <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags. Your original writing should be included on
                        one of these pages, the order/location in which it appears is up to you. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Part 4 CSS:<br>Make a second version of your tour using HTML and CSS. This version can be
                        totally different from Part 2. </li>
