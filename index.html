    Course Description 
    <br>
<p>This course is concerned with the affective qualities interactive experiences can have. An interaction can happen in real space as well as online, one doesn’t outweigh the other, and both are integral to our day-to-day life. This semester we will be exploring the mesh between digital life and the physical world. </p>

<p>In this course you will learn to think of code as a creative medium. In the same way that oil paint, clay, and charcoal are considered mediums for visualizing ideas, code has the same potential to express and visualize ideas in surprising ways. The projects completed in this course will be made for the web browser with simultaneous crossover to physical spaces, and tangible objects.</p>
<p>During the course we will think about the relationships between our digital and physical spaces, while considering their ephemeral traits, as well as their capacity for perpetuity and for creating community. We will also have frequent conversations about transmission, and audience, as they are crucial things to consider when making interactive work—How does the world access the project? Who is it for? As a class, and through your projects, we will explore the ways participatory and web-based work can invite interaction, respond to our lived experience, and be an extension of it. </p>

<p>Through readings and group discussions we will learn about the internet and its history, discuss current trends, all while studying the varied ways creative practitioners use code, and the web as a medium. </p>

 <p>Outcomes</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion-panel">
    This is a studio course, meaning most of your learning will be by doing. This class meets a total of 30 times on Gather, with in person final presentations in room ARTB 108. While a general overview of skills is given in class, the best way to learn is through independent study, and practice.
<br>
<br>
	This semester we will be:
    <br>
<ol>   
<li>Making and learning through a combination of workshops, demos, lectures, or other presentations</li>
<li>Doing weekly in-class exercises</li>
<li>Sharing our work, as well as the work of artists that we reference</li>
<li>Reading, Watching, Discussing, Writing: There will be weekly readings/videos as well as mandatory written responses to these. </li>
<li>Critiquing work as a group and through 1x1 desk visits with the instructor </li>
</ol>

<p>Grading</p>
    </div>

<div class="accordion-panel">
    <p>Projects 1-3 will be graded on their quality in both a technical and conceptual level. Your final projects should clearly express their concept, and be as intuitive as possible. Taking risks is encouraged in this class, as that is the only way to truly experiment with a new medium. If any situations develop over the course of the semester that are affecting your ability to be a student, please share them with me, so that I can better support you in your education.</p>

<ul class="a">
<li>15% Project 1</li>
<li>15% Project 2</li>
<li>15% Project 3</li>
<li>15% Class website</li>
<li>40% Participation & Process: <br>Group discussions, desk visits with professor, critique, in class exercises, readings, reading responses, iterative process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assignments are physically due at the start of class. Late work is noted as such and will be deducted from your overall grade. Late work with a valid excuse (illness, family emergency, etc.) will be excused; please email me as soon as you are able to.</p>

<p>The class website is your homepage. It should include your exercises, reading responses, and final projects. </p>

<div class="accordion-panel">
    <p><em>Academic Honesty</em></p>
        <p> Academic honesty in design courses means only turning in your own
        work. Academic dishonesty carries serious penalties and will result in
        failure.</p>
        
        <p><em>Accommodations for Documented Disability</em></p>
        <p>Students requesting accommodations due to a documented disability
        or temporary injury should contact UConn’s Center for Students with
        Disabilities (CSD). You may contact CSD by calling 860-486-2020 or by
        e-mailing CSD@uconn.edu. If your request for accommodations is
        approved, accommodation letters will be provided by the CSD. Please
        present your official letter to the instructor as soon as possible so appropriate
        arrangements can be made. (Note: Student requests for accommodations
        must be filed each semester.)</p>
        
        
       <p><em>Sexual Assault Reporting Policy</em></p> 
        <p>To protect the campus community, all non-confidential University employees
        (including faculty) are required to report assaults they witness or are
        told about to the Office of Diversity & Equity under the Sexual Assault
        Response Policy. The University takes all reports with the utmost seriousness.
        Please be aware that while the information you provide will remain
        private, it will not be confidential and will be shared with University officials
        who can help. More information is available at titleix.uconn.edu.
        </p>

        <p><em>Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment
        & Inappropriate Romantic Relationships</em></p>
        <p>The University is committed to maintaining an environment free of discrimination
        or discriminatory harassment directed toward any person or
        group within its community—students, employees, or visitors. Academic
        and professional excellence can flourish only when each member of our
        community is assured an atmosphere of mutual respect. All members of
        the University community are responsible for the maintenance of an academic
        and work environment in which people are free to learn and work
        without fear of discrimination or discriminatory harassment. In addition,
        inappropriate Romantic relationships can undermine the University’s mission
        when those in positions of authority abuse or appear to abuse their
        authority. To that end, and in accordance with federal and state law, the
        University prohibits discrimination and discriminatory harassment, as well
        as inappropriate Romantic relationships, and such behavior will be met
        with appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from
        the University. More information is available at policy.uconn.edu.
